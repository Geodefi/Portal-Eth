Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n *\n * For example:\n *\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n * ```\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\n *         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n *     }\n * }\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n *     }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n *\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n *\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n * contract, which may impact the proxy.

Initiators and Configurable Staking Pools.\n * * 2. Pool and Operator management.\n * * 3. Validator Delegation.\n * * 4. Depositing.\n * * 5. Staking Operations.\n *\n * @dev review: DataStoreModule for the IsolatedStorage logic.\n * @dev review: OracleExtensionLib for oracle logic.\n *\n * @dev Every pool is isolated and every validator is unique. Segregate all the risk.\n *\n * @dev CONTROLLER and Maintainer:\n * CONTROLLER is the owner of an ID, it manages the pool/operator. Its security is exteremely important.\n * maintainer is the worker, can be used to automate some daily tasks:\n * * distributing validators for Staking Pools or creating validators for Operators.\n * * not so crucial in terms of security.\n *\n * @dev Users:\n * Type 4 : Permissioned Operators\n * * Needs to be onboarded by the Dual Governance (Senate + Governance).\n * * Maintains Beacon Chain Validators on behalf of the Staking Pools.\n * * Can participate in the Operator Marketplace after initiation.\n * * Can utilize maintainers for staking operations.\n *\n * Type 5 : Permissionless Configurable Staking Pools\n * * Permissionless to create.\n * * Can utilize powers of packages and middlewares such as Bound Liquidity Pools, gETHMiddlewares etc.\n * * Can be public or private, can use a whitelist if private.\n * * Can utilize maintainers for validator distribution on Operator Marketplace.\n * * Uses a Withdrawal Contract to be given as withdrawalCredential on validator creation,\n * * accruing rewards and keeping Staked Ether safe and isolated.\n *\n * @dev Packages:\n * An ID can only point to 1(one) Package version at a time.\n * Built by utilizing the Modules!\n * Can be upgraded by a dual governance, via pullUpgrade.\n * * A Package's dual governance consists of Portal(governance) and the pool owner(senate).\n *\n * Type 10011 : Withdrawal Contract\n * *
