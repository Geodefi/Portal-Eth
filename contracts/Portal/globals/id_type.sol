/**
 * @notice ID_TYPE is an internal library that acts like an ENUM.
 *
 * @dev Used within the limited upgradability pattern:
 *
 * NONE & GAP: should not be used.
 *
 * Dual Governance:
 * * SENATE: points to a proposal that will update the current SENATE address of a package(or Portal).
 * * CONTRACT_UPGRADE: proposal to change the given contract's implementation.
 *
 * Users:
 * * OPERATOR: permissionned Node Operators (hosted on Portal).
 * * POOL: permissionless staking pools (hosted on Portal).
 *
 * Packages: (hosted on StakeModuleLib)
 * * An ID can only point to 1(one) Package version' implementation address at a given point.
 * * Can be upgraded by a dual governance, via pullUpgrade.
 * * * Portal's dual governance consists of a Governance Token(governance) and a Senate(senate).
 * * * A Package's dual governance consists of Portal(governance) and the pool owner(senate).
 * * Built by utilizing the Modules.
 * * LiquidityPool and WithdrawalContract are some examples.
 *
 * Middlewares: (hosted on StakeModuleLib)
 * * An ID can point to multiple Middleware version' implementation address at the same time.
 * * Can not be upgraded.
 * * Do not have any guides to build really.
 * * Currently only gETHMiddlewares
 *
 *  Limits:
 *  * We simply set limits to separate a group of types from others. Like Packages and Middlewares.
 *
 * @dev all LIMIT parameters are exclusive, prevents double usage.
